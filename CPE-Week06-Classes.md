In Week 6 we will introduce the following topics:
- [Transistor](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KpK2u7tlg9IpjeqpNTxizabOwoFxsuq-k4WMEPzzcE4/) â€“ The transistor is essentially a circuit-level switch
- [Classes](https://github.com/CE-Curriculum-Development/mat-cpe-1040/edit/master/CPE-Week06-Classes.md) - The programming language facility for user-defined data types and the heart of object-oriented programming

_**A note on the language:** Traditional mainstream JavaScript and TypeScript differ in their support of the so called classical or object-oriented class model. JavaScript has [**prorotype-based inheritance**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain). Support for explicit `class`-es has only been added in the latest ECMA standard and is still only syntactic sugar, while JS remains strictly prototype-based. TypeScript supports the [**object-oriented model**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/classes.html), familiar to Java and C++ programmers, though it too ultimately compiles down to canonic JavaScript. The prototype approach is considered more powerful and indeed TS builds their `class`-es on top of it. Once again, as this is a micro:bit and MakeCode focused document, the rest of the document describes the TypeScript "classical" object-oriented inheritance style.

## Classes 

Classes are *templates* for complex data objects. They can be thought of as cookie cutters, where the cut cookies are the objects. A class is defined with special syntax by the programmer. It contains local data and methods. Thus, classes are *user-defined complex data types*. Therefore, we will use "class" and "type" interchangeably. There is quite a lot to be said about classes and objects, so we'll take it slow. 

The MakeCode JavaScript Reference has a separate page on [Classes](https://makecode.microbit.org/javascript/classes), which is quite good. The DevDocs JavaScript Reference has a short page on [Classes](https://devdocs.io/javascript/statements/class). The official TypeScript documentation has an extensive section on [Classes](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/classes.html).

## Demo 

These language features are best demonstrated in working code in a familiar environment. We have created an example on top of the Bouncing Sprite from Assignment 2.  

The code can be found on this Github [gist](https://gist.github.com/ivogeorg/be8b11ca24f118fd63c0407e93c81f81), and can be copy-pasted into the MakeCode JavaScript editor. Read the inline comments for clarification. Note that the simulator may not show the behavior correctly. Program your micro:bit and look at it in the dark. Press the buttons to see what they do.

## Walkthrough

Here we will show in detail how using classes and objects allowed us to create a sprite with a halo that can be turned on and off. For the uses of arrays and `for` loops in the demo, refer to the earlier document on [arrays and `for` loops](CPE-Week03-JavaScript-Arrays-Loops-Classes.md).

### 1. Inheritance: Extending a class

First of all, the `game.LedSprite` was already a class with most of the funcitonality that we needed. In fact, we only wanted to modify the sprite a little. A class declaration looks like this:

```TypeScript
class Sprite {

}
```
We just have the `class` keyword, the _capitalized_ class name, and the _block statement_. The latter should be familiar from the earlier document on [statements](CPE-Week04-JavaScript-Statements.md). Inside the block statement, the data and the methods of the type are defined. 

Because we don't want to redefine the whole class, we instead _extend_ the an already existing class. The declaration looks like this:

```TypeScript
class BouncySprite extends game.LedSprite {

}
```

Here, the _base_ (that is, the already existing) class which we are extending is `game.LedSprite`, while the _derived_ (that is, the extending) class is `BouncySprite`. Inside the block statement, we only define the additional features or feature modifications, while we _inherit_ all the rest of the functionality from the base class.

### 2. Defining the halo

The only way we want to change the base `game.LedSprite` is to add an _optional_ "halo" around it as it moves. The halo is just the surrounding 8 positions around the current position of the sprite, lit with lower brightness than the sprite itself. In terms of data, we need to add only two things to our derived class that don't exist in the base class: 
  1. `hasHalo` variable for whether the sprite has a halo or not, so just a `boolean`; and   
  2. `adjArr` for the description of the halo positions relative to the sprite position, so an array.   

The code for the `boolean` is straightforward:

```TypeScript
class BouncySprite extends game.LedSprite {
    hasHalo : boolean = false
  
}
```
We define the extra variable right inside the block statement (and scope) of the class.   

The array of halo positions is a _two-dimensional_ array, that is, an array of arrays. This doesn't change anything significant about the array, except that it will have a two array index operators `[][]` when we want a value from the inner arrays. Let's see the code:

```TypeScript
class BouncySprite extends game.LedSprite {
    hasHalo : boolean = false

    private adjArr = [
        [0, -1, 0.67],
        [0, 1, 0.67],
        [-1, 0, 0.67],
        [1, 0, 0.67],
        [-1, -1, 0.40],
        [-1, 1, 0.40],
        [1, -1, 0.40],
        [1, 1, 0.40]
    ]  
}
```
Each of the inner arrays contains, in this order, an additive x offset, a additive y offset, and a multiplicative brightness coefficient. They can be applied to any sprite at current position `(x, y)` and brightness `b` to light up one of the adjacent positions from the halo. For the first inner array, this will result in `(x, y - 1, b * 0.67)`. This is how we get the halo!  

### 3. Drawing the halo
