In Week 6, we are introducting the following topics: 
- [The transistor](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KpK2u7tlg9IpjeqpNTxizabOwoFxsuq-k4WMEPzzcE4/) – A circuit-level switch and the most important active element in electronics
- [Memory]() – How do we build one of the fundamental components of computers?
- [Processor]() - How do we build the heart of the computer?
- [Classes]() - The programming language facility for user-defined data types and the heart of object-oriented programming

## Classes 

Classes are *templates* for complex data objects. They can be thought of as cookie cutters, where the cut cookies are the objects. A class is defined with special syntax by the programmer. It contains local data and methods. Thus, classes are *user-defined complex data types*. There is quite a lot to be said about classes and objects, so we'll take it slow. 

 

The MakeCode JavaScript Reference has a separate page on [Classes](https://makecode.microbit.org/javascript/classes), which is quite good. The DevDocs JavaScript Reference has a short page on [Classes](https://devdocs.io/javascript/statements/class). 

 

## Demo 

These language features are best demonstrated in working code in a familiar environment. We have created an example on top of the Bouncing Sprite from Assignment 2.  

 

The code can be found on this Github [gist](https://gist.github.com/ivogeorg/be8b11ca24f118fd63c0407e93c81f81), and can be copy-pasted into the MakeCode JavaScript editor. Read the inline comments for clarification. Note that the simulator does not show the behavior correctly. Program your micro:bit and look at it in the dark. Press the buttons to see what they do.
